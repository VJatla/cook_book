#+Title: Red coconut chutney

This chutney is good to eat with hot rice and kudumulu. I don't
particularly find it interesting to eat with breakfast like idly and
dosa.

1. Sautee till fragrent in a low flame.

   - Chana dal : 1 tsp +
   - Urud dal  : 1 tsp +
   - Coriander seeds : 1 tsp +
   - Cumin seeds : 1/2 tsp

2. Add 8-10 (as per taste) dry red chilli and curry leaves. Fry for a
   bit.

3. 1 cup raw coconut cubes and sautee for 2 to 3 minutes.

4. Cool

5. Add mixture to grinder.
   
6. To this add

   - 4 cloves of garlic,
   - 1 small tamrind (key lime size).
   - Salt

7. Grind (no need of water when using fresh coconut cubes).
